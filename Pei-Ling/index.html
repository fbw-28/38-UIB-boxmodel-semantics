                <h3>It's wonderful to own a cat!</h3>
                <p>I didn't realize how wonderful it could be to live with a cat until I adopted mine. A cat teaches you most meaningful ideas for life. All she or he needs is food, home, and love! How simply is that!</p>

                <h3>It's just the beginning of caring!</h3>
                <p>You might think it was hard to find a seller or an animal shelter to offer you a cat? Now you've got it, and it's the begging of 365-day job for 15, or 20, or 30+ years (if you are lucky) to clean up your cat's toilet, feed, combing the fur, lots of vacuuming the floor, play with, love, and last but not the least, bring the cat to the doctor! All such sweet burdens just tells you that you are better that that, SO YOU'RE DOING IT!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't treat your cat like the background of the family. Treat your cat like a person.</li>
                        <li>The more unselfish love you give the cat the more decent you are.</li> 
                        <li>Never give up the cat!</li>
