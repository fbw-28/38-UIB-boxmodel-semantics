        <h4>Some generic Corona for you.</h4>

        <h2>Corona level</h2>
        <p>A corona discharge is an electrical discharge brought on by the
        ionization of a fluid such as air surrounding a conductor that is electrically charged></p>

        <h2>Second level</h2>
        <p>Corona discharges can often be suppressed by improved insulation, corona rings, and making high voltage electrodes in smooth rounded shapes. 
            However, controlled corona discharges are used in a variety of processes such as air filtration, photocopiers, and ozone generators.</p>
