        <h1>Ball Culture</h1>
        <p>Ball culture, drag ball culture, the house-ballroom community, and similar terms describe an underground LGBT
            subculture that originated in 1920s New York City, United States, in which people "walk" (i.e., compete) for
            trophies, prizes, and glory at events known as balls. Ball culture consists of events that mix performance,
            dance, lip-syncing, and modeling. Events are divided into various categories, and participants "walk" and
            compete for prizes and trophies. As a countercultural phenomenon, ball culture is rooted in necessity and
            defiance. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, members of the underground LGBTQ+ community in large
            cities began to organize masquerade balls
            known as "drags" in defiance of laws which banned individuals from wearing clothes associated with the
            opposite gender.</p>
